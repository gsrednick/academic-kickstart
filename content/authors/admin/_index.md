Greetings! I am a PhD candidate in Dr. Stephen Swearerâ€™s [REEF](https://reef.edu.au//) laboratory group and [NCCC](https://nccc.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne. I am a Community Ecologist broadly focused on the spatiotemporal dynamics of marine communities. Specifically, I study the abiotic (e.g., environmental variation) and biotic conditions (e.g., species interactions) that contribute to ecological state and trajectories.
