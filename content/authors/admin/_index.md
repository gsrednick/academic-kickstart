I am a community ecologist broadly focused on the spatiotemporal dynamics of marine communities. Specifically, I study how the dynamic interplay between environmental conditions and interactions between species contribute to ecological state and trajectories in marine ecosystems. 

I am currently National Science Foundation Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Coastal Dynamics Laboratory](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/davis/) at Stanford University with Professors [Kristen Davis](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/davis/) and [Peter Edmunds](https://mcr.lternet.edu/people/peter-edmunds). My postdoctoral work is focused on evaluating the mechanisms underlying emergent patterns of coral reef recovery in Moorea, French Polynesia. This work leverages data and efforts from the [Moorea Coral Reef Long-Term Ecological Research Program](https://mcr.lternet.edu/).
